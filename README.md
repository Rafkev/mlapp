Machine Learning Dart Application with Firebase MLkit
Building a Machine Learning (ML) application in Dart that utilizes Firebase ML Kit involves integrating Firebase ML Kit into your Flutter app to leverage its machine learning capabilities. Firebase ML Kit offers a range of pre-built machine learning models that can be easily integrated into Flutter apps for various tasks like image labeling, text recognition, barcode scanning, etc.

Below is an example of how you can create a simple Flutter app that uses Firebase ML Kit for text recognition:

1.) Set up Firebase for your Flutter app by following the instructions on the Firebase website.

2.) Add the necessary dependencies to your pubspec.yaml file

3.) Import the required packages in your Dart file and initialize Firebase

4.) Create a Flutter widget that allows users to select an image from the device gallery and performs text recognition using Firebase ML Kit


This Dart code creates a simple Flutter app that allows users to select an image from the device gallery. After selecting an image, Firebase ML Kit is used to perform text recognition on the image, and the recognized text is displayed on the screen.

Remember to replace the dependency versions in the pubspec.yaml file with the latest versions available at the time of development. Additionally, ensure that you have set up Firebase correctly and have enabled the necessary services in the Firebase console. Feel free to extend the funtionalities
